# Computer lab environments

This repository contains some helper scripts for setting up the computer environments for courses associated with the Design Automation Laboratory at Linköping University.

Unless stated otherwise, the scripts are meant to be run on university computers only.

## Instructions for students

Found your way here? Nice! Your teachers should supply you with the correct helper script. Just run it and you should be ready to go.

Found a bug? Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!

## Instructions for teachers

Supply the students with the `bat` file for the corresponding course. For instance, if you're running the TMKT79 course, hand out *only* the `tmkt79/tmkt79-environment.bat` file. The script will always download the latest version of the other helper scripts from this repository.

When you need to update anything, commit and push the changes to this repository. The next time the students run the script, they will automagically get the latest version. ✨
